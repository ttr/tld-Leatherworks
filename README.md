# Leatherworks
Leatherworks is a mod, that gives players a way to renew leather to craft and mend items in the game and/or added by other mods.

* Find treebark to create tanning or turn it into prepared treebark
* Turn prepared treebark into different foods or create flour from grinding a large amount of fried prepared bark with a hammer or stone
* Scrape animal hides to get scraped leather
* Soak scraped leather in tanning to get raw leather down the line

# DLC is REQUIRED for this mod to work

Currently, all future plans for this mod have been put on hold, due to data loss. Consider the mod finished in its current state.
If you run into issues, do let me know, thanks

## Changelog

**V1.0:**

* Added treebark. Spawn chance can be tweaked in settings
* Added recipes for tanning, bark noodles and bark bannock, both in normal bark and birch bark variants (Birch bark variant is currently missing its restore condition buff)
* Fry prepared treebark, which can be done both singularly or in a pile, into a snack or to grind it down into flour. 
* Added the option to scrape animal hides. Can be tweaked in settings, if this would apply for only cured or cured and fresh hides
* Added scraped leather, which can be acquired from scraping hide
* Added 3 different variations of the metal box. Filled with tanning, leather soaking in tanning (This can cure both indoors and outdoors) and leather finished soaking (harvest to get your raw leather, which then has to air dry)
  
**V1.1:**

* Added the ability to fry Prepared Birch (it's a hacky way, but it works, cause that's modding right?)
* Added buffs to Birch (Restore condition) and Bark (Increased carry weight) foods, including fried versions
* Added Bark Bope (3 prepared bark), which in turn can be turned into a String Bundle (also 3 bark rope)
* Fixed so scraping hides, and now also making bark rope, reduces the durability on your knife
* Added a crafting recipe for the Leather Flight Jacket
* Added Improved Down Insulation, Improved Thermal Underwear and Improved Leather Jacket (My artistic skills aren't great, but that was evident already I think)
* Added crafting recipes for the Leather Flight Jacket, Improved Down Insulation, Improved Underwear and Improved Flight Jacket
* Added settings to customize item amounts needed for making flour and filling a metal box with tanning

**V1.1.2**

* Added a separate DLL for Camping Tools compatibility (Uninstall Leatherworks and replace it with LeatherworksCT if you want the ability to use the Camping Tools knives)
* Tweaked the buffs of Birch Bark and Bark foods
* Added a small fatigue buff to Acorns (Cooked - Large Portion)
* Reduced durability loss (5 -> 3) of knife on making bark rope
* Fixed Improved Underwear and Improved Leather Jacket needing Cured Deer Hide instead of Cured Leather to repair

**V1.2**

* Added the Improvised Flask, a craftable weaker variant of the Insulated Flask
* Added 4 new Insulated Flask variants, 3 of them being normal with the 4th being an easter egg and has unique traits (Good luck finding that one). Currently they only have 1 spawn point that is guaranteed
* Added the Prytool, a craftable prybar with 2 uses
* Added a blueprint for making Prepared Bark to make bulk harvesting a bit better
* Increased the amount of bark needed to make bark rope (3 -> 4)
